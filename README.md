# ruckus_test


Initial setup of repository is done in a standard manner.  Consider adding 
a `.gitignore` file to make sure you are not clogging your repo with unnecessary files 
from Vivado.   

Set up your directory structure: 

```
mkdir submodules
mkdir software
mkdir firmware
```

Minimally, you need the ruckus repo as a submodule:

`git submodule add git@github.com:slaclab/ruckus.git`

Then, add any other submodules that you need.
